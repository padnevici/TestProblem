#### Notes ####
1. Test case 5 and 16 produce fail. The framework is not perfect so, if other test cases are failed too, then you can re-run them. All test cases are independent. 
2. When you execute tests it is better to not use PC in that moment. Any parallel actions can broke the execution and produce unnecessary fails.
